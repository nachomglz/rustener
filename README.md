# Rustener

Rustener is an URL shortener written in Rust just for fun :)

## Idea

The main idea would be to create a basic Rest API which creates shortened URL's, when this works I would like to add payments using Stripe or other payment gateways.

## Why Rust?

Just to try and do things as barebones as possible :), not using many libraries and stuff like that.
